**Q: Is owning Minecraft required to play The World R:Craft?**<br>
A: No, we use a custom account system.

**Q: The game is complaining that I have missing mods!**<br>
A: You are most likely using an older version of the launcher. We have a new GitHub repo page, which can be found in the Downloads section or click the GitHub link above.

**Q: Do I need to install Java myself to play this?**<br>
A: No, if you do not have the correct Java version installed, the launcher will now detect this and install the correct version for you. We use https://adoptopenjdk.net/ to get the needed Java installer. #adoptopenjdk

**Q: I can't change my class! What do I do?**<br>
A: If you want to change your class - contact AzureZhen on Discord to have him wipe your player data, which causes you to lose everything you've earned so far. Make sure you want to do it before contacting him.

**Q: The game keeps changing! Things aren't same as before or are broken! When will it stay stable?**<br>
A: The game is currently in Alpha, which means we are still building the core gameplay. Beta will be reached once we have finished all the Root Towns and have all the core systems finallized.
