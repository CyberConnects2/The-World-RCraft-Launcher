# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is owning Minecraft required to play The World R:Craft?**<br>
A: No, we uses the system that does not touch Mojang servers at all. In other words, we use CyberConnects2's login system instead of theirs.

**Q: Do I need to install Java myself to play this?**<br>
A: No, if you do not have the correct Java version installed, the launcher will now detect this and install the correct version for you. We use https://adoptopenjdk.net/ to get the needed Java installer. #adoptopenjdk
