**Q: Is owning Minecraft required to play The World R:Craft?**<br>
A: No, we uses the system that does not touch Mojang servers at all. In other words, we use CyberConnects2's login system instead of theirs.

**Q: The game is complaining that I have missing mods!**<br>
A: You are using an older version of the launcher downloaded from either an official website or an old GitHub repo page. We have a new GitHub repo page, and please go to the Downloads section to download the new launcher or click the GitHub link above.

**Q: Do I need to install Java myself to play this?**<br>
A: No, if you do not have the correct Java version installed, the launcher will now detect this and install the correct version for you. We use https://adoptopenjdk.net/ to get the needed Java installer. #adoptopenjdk

**Q: I can't change my class! What do I do?**<br>

**Q: The game kept changing! They either aren't same as before or are broken! When will it stay stable?**<br>
