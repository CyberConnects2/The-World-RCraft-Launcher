# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is owning Minecraft required to play The World R:Craft?**<br>
A: No, we uses the system that does not touch Mojang servers at all. In other words, we use CyberConnects2's login system instead of theirs.

**Q: Do I need to install Java myself to play this?**<br>
A: No, if you do not have the correct Java version installed, the launcher will now detect this and install the correct version for you. We use https://adoptopenjdk.net/ to get the needed Java installer. #adoptopenjdk

**Q: I can't change my class! What do I do?**<br>
A: If you want to change class - contact AzureZhen on Discord to have him wipe your player data, which causes you to lose everything you've earned so far. Make sure you want to do it before contacting him.
