The launcher can be added to Steam as a non-Steam game. Grab the Steam grid above (click on it) to use as a custom grid on Steam as well! This section is useful for players who want to play The World R:Craft with controllers instead of bashing their head on controller config in-game or messing around with third-party software such as DS4Windows. Out of all the third-party software availability, Steam is probably the best for its controller configuration. What it does is to emulate the X360, keyboard/mouse, or both profiles into the controller (Steam, Xbox, Dualshock, Switch Pro, and other generic controllers) to be usable in most games that use DirectX9 and above. Thankfully, The World R:Craft is one of them! However, for this game, we will use keyboard/mouse binds instead so the controller will work as smooth as it would in every other game.

1. Ensure Steam Overlay is enabled for all games or non-Steam games.
	1. Open settings on Steam.
	2. Click "In-Game" tab on the left.
	3. Tick "Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game."
	4. (Optional) Tick ‘Use the Big Picture Overlay when using Steam Input enabled controller from the desktop’.
	
	> [!NOTE]
	> If you don’t enable this option, you probably will have to use Big Picture mode to be able to use controller in-game.
	
2. Add the launcher to Steam as a non-Steam game. Rename it to "The World R:Craft".
	1. (Optional) Add the Steam Grid image.
	
3. Download the controller configuration ZIP file [here](https://mega.nz/#!axozQALZ!VMkbhUfncqmgUO7xoBgBG6DUUm-0mdtHh1BkwBCN-Uo).
4. Extract and move the folder to \Steam\userdata\[userID]\config\controller_configs\apps\.
5. Restart Steam.
6. Start the game and play!

> [!NOTE]
> The launcher needs to stay open while the game is running. If the launcher is closed while the game is running, the controller may not work.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not bind the X360 buttons to your controller while using this game in Steam. It might will not work well, since the mod Joypad in-game is weird.
